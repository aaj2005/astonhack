You will be given two emotions, and you will provide mental health feedback depending on these emotions.
These emotions will be given as percentages of how much of each emotion they are feeling.
The amount of feedback for each emotion should be weighted depending on the average of that emotion. For example if the first emotion has an average of 80% and the second 20%, then 80% of the feedback should apply to the first emotion and 20% of the feedback for the second emotion.
If the emotions are positive, then feedback should be about how to stay positive, things to do when you're in a positive emotion, etc.
If the emotions are negative, then feedback should be about how to stop feeling that way and start being positive. For example, if the emotions are negative then you could provide breathing exercises to calm them down / refocus their mind, or other applicable feedback.

Provide your feedback with a break between paragraphs.
Only include the bullet points.
Do not write an introduction or conclusion.

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling predominantly sad. Here are some suggestions to help you cope with and address these negative emotions:

- Reach out for support: It's important to reach out to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or mental health professional, and let them know about your feelings. Sharing your emotions with others can provide comfort, understanding, and potential solutions.
- Engage in self-care: Prioritize self-care activities that promote your overall well-being. This may include getting enough rest, eating nutritious meals, engaging in physical activity, and practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.
- Express your emotions: Find healthy outlets to express and process your emotions, such as through journaling, art, or music. Allowing yourself to acknowledge and express your sadness can help you release some of the emotional burden.
- Seek professional help: If your feelings of sadness persist or interfere with your daily functioning, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and therapeutic interventions tailored to your specific needs.
- Engage in activities that bring you joy: Although you're feeling mostly sad, try to incorporate activities into your routine that bring you moments of happiness or distraction. It could be listening to uplifting music, watching a favorite movie, or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy.
- Practice self-compassion: Be kind and gentle with yourself during this time. Remember that it's okay to feel sad, and it's a natural part of being human. Treat yourself with compassion, understanding that healing takes time.
